# Diabetic-project 
# This ptoject involve try To build a model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on various features,

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the patient (years).
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient is diabetic (1) or not (0).
